# ice3.6.5_for_aarch64_whl
whl file to set up ice 3.6.5 in my python virtual environment, built on __Ubuntu 20.04__ ARM64 (by the looks of it, it might work on Centos 7 too)    
used it while creating omero.web & server  
there's also .tar.gz for manual installation of ZerocIce dev package 3.6.5  
```
pip install 'https://github.com/janbern/ice3.6.5_for_aarch64_whl/releases/download/aarch64/zeroc_ice-3.6.5-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl'
